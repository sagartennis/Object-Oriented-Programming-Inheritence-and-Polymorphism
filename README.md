## INTERFACE PROBLEM ##

Please implement:

An interface named SwordFighter. The interface should contain the following variable and methods: 
An int variable maxSwordsWielded, which should be set to 2 
An abstract void method escape() 
An abstract void method showWeapon()
An abstract void method attack()

In the Knight class, please override the showWeapon() method from the SwordFighter interface, and the method should print out "Shows Sword" in a new line

In the Ninja class, please override the showWeapon() class from theSwordFighter  interface, and the method should print out  "Shows Katana" in a new line

## ABSTRACT PROBLEM ##

Given an abstract class Quadrilateral, create subclasses Parallelogram, Rhombus, Rectangle, and Square, which implement the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods correctly.

Note: You can look into the stub file to figure out what is the input we are taking and the output we are producing.

Sample Input 

5.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 8.0 4.0 9.0

Sample Output 

Parallelogram Perimeter: 18.0
Parallelogram Area: 15.0
Rhombus Perimeter: 20.0
Rhombus Area: 20.0
Rectangle Perimeter: 24.0
Rectangle Area: 32.0
Square Perimeter: 36.0
Square Area: 81.0
